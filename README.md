# PRODIGY_CS_03
# Password Complexity Checker

This project provides a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) application for checking the strength of passwords in Python. It evaluates the complexity of passwords based on certain criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/password_complexity_checker.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd password_complexity_checker
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python password_complexity_checker.py
    ```

4. Enter your password in the provided input field.

5. Click the "Check Strength" button to evaluate the strength of the entered password.

6. If the password does not meet the complexity requirements, a popup window will display the requirements that need to be fulfilled.

7. If the password meets the complexity requirements, a message box will display the strength of the password.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included in Python installations)
- re library (usually included in Python installations)
